From Milestone 2, I have changed a lot. First, I have created three classes, namely car, Light and crossroads to draw and analyze these things. I believe it will be much easier to deal with than function. Besides, I have re-written the 'plate' function and named it 'plate2' after having a brief conversation with TA. The previous one didn't seem to satisfy the requirement. Also, I have given up using timer in my program, since that's too complicated. I just simply 'pause (1)' for every loop to control time.
